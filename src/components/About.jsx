            <p>
                I am a fifth year computer engineering student at Northeastern University, with an interest in software development, embedded systems, and machine learning. This is my first ever react application, and I am always looking to learn new things in software.

            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, contributing to open-source, and exploring the latest trends in technology.
